      <description>In this blog we will discuss steps to install your own Ethereum blockchain in your local Ubuntu computer, for testing purposes. We can also use this local instance to deploy our smart contracts.
For deploying and running the Ethereum blockchain, we will use Go Ethereum also know as Geth. Geth is a command line interface for running Ethereum node. It is implemented in Go Language. Using Geth you can join Ethereum network, transfer ether between accounts, create ethereum network or even mine ethers.</description>
